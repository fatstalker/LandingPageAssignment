fix spaces in header, particularly between the title and the paragraph. When the rendering is narrow enough it looks fine, but when it widen the space becomes too much.
the padding in the footer doesn't go to the very end of the page with extremely narrow screens.
the boxes section doesn't have side margins with narrow screens.
quote section too isn't perfect with narrow screens
